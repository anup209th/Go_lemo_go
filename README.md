# Go_lemo_go
This project is a creative hardware implementation of a Finite State Machine (FSM) inspired by a Verilog-based Lemmings controller. Instead of simulating it in an FPGA, the FSM is portably implemented on an 8051 microcontroller using pure assembly language, interfaced with push buttons and LEDs to simulate the behavior of a classic Lemmings game logic.
